Example for Developing Networked Software with Ruby
---------------------------------------------------

This repository demonstrates one way to build networked software in Ruby.

Expected Functionality
----------------------

Roll a number of dice with a number of sides.

Requirements
------------

A working installation of Ruby, version 2.0 or higher.

Basic knowledge of Ruby is assumed, but not required. The example is deliberately simple, and each iteration should introduce a single new concept.
